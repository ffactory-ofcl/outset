Outset
======

This web app uses the http://unsplash.it API to grab random images from http://unsplash.com and display them in a slideshow format on the users screen.

It works purely on javascript and it should work on a majority of modern browsers.

Currently allows the user to change the frequency at which the images will change and allows the user to blur the image through the API.

Feel free to fork it and make it better.
